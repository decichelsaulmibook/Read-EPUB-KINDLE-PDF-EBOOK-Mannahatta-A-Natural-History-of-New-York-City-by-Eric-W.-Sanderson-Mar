Review: This book will provide the layperson with a detailed history of New York from 1609 going forward. Both indigenous Americans, colonial period, the revolutionary war and after. An human and ecological history of this great city.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars The rural countryside of Manhattan
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 8, 2014
Review: For some time, I've idly wondered if Manhattan, in its pre built-up days, ever had streams and ponds, or if it simply wasn't large enough for that. Well, thanks to this book, now I know: it did indeed have them, quite a few actually. This and so much more I learned from this extensively researched and profusely illustrated look back on what that relatively small island near the Hudson River's mouth looked like before the European settlers got their hands on it.

The detailed descriptions of the island's natural features -- its streams, ponds, hills, woodlands, and so on -- as well as its flora and fauna are fascinating. But what really did it for me were the illustrations: breathtaking views of the beautiful, unspoiled terrain. The pictures alone were worth the price of the book, and in fact my only "complaint" is that I wish there could have been more of them. (Keep in mind, there are already lots and lots of them.) Though, given the incredible amount of detail in the text, I do realize that there simply wasn't enough room for more.

Just so you know, this is a heavy book; it's printed on thick, almost hard-stock paper. I think this definitely helps show the clarity of the illustrations (you can't see through the pages to what's on the other side), but this is not a good book to take with you when you're traveling. Much better to read it at home.

The final chapter, which gives the author's take on what New York City might look like 400 years from now, seemed quite unrealistic to me. He envisions a city whose population resides in densely packed strips along the rivers, while the great majority of the outer boroughs are given over to farmland. There are no cars in Future New York, and the subways have been converted to solely carry freight. People get around on foot, on bicycle, or on streetcars (i.e. old fashioned trolleys) -- and never mind that the reason the subways were built in the first place was because the existing streetcar network couldn't handle the overwhelming passenger traffic, not to mention they were too slow, mired in surface-street congestion. As for long-distance travel, I couldn't quite tell from the simulated satellite view, but it kind of looked like the city's airports have been converted into farmland as well. I guess we'll all be riding trains across the country, or ships across the ocean. ("Back to the future" indeed!)

Certainly, this "back-to-nature" view of the future runs counter to the recent historical trend of suburban sprawl expanding ever outward. It's simply impossible for me to imagine the people of the future being willing to pack themselves in like sardines in high-rise apartment buildings whose windows overlook acres and acres of "empty" farmland right next door. For such a change to occur would require either a sea change in society's views towards its own living arrangements whose scope would be unprecedented in human history -- or else, governmental zoning regulations so draconian that Joseph Stalin would turn away from them in horror.

Nevertheless, I realize that I'm being nitpicky. We can all speculate about what the future holds, but that's not the point. This is not a book about New York's future, but about its past. And in that, it succeeds gloriously. If you've ever wondered what today's "concrete jungle" looked like when it was a real jungle, this is the book for you.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Not Quite What I expected
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 15, 2009
Review: This is a heavy and substantial tome (inevitably printed in China - where else?) which details the author's amazing work in reconstructing the stunningly-beautiful natural environment of Manhattan Island in 1609, when the Dutch explorer Henry Hudson and his crew first laid eyes on it.

This much I already knew before purchasing the book, but frankly, I was disappointed when I actually got it. In part this is because the book seems to struggle to decide what it wants to be. A major portion does indeed deal with Manhattan Island in 1609. There are a number of amazing images put together with the latest computer-generated image technology after painstaking field research and with the 18th century British headquarters map. They depict a Manhattan so beautiful it brings tears to the eyes, particularly when you consider how totally the natural environment of the island has been destroyed. Still, I was left only half-satisfied, and would love to have seen something other than simulated aerial views, i.e. some neighborhood by neighborhood ground-level close-ups with descriptions (maybe they exist somewhere, but the link to the [...] website printed on the book's jacket didn't work; perhaps it's not up yet). But apart from reprints of historical paintings and drawings, there is less detail than I would have expected. Nor is there much discussion (apart from references to the laying-out of the grid street-plan and the grading involved) of the Manhattan archeological record, or of the massive and traumatic process of changing the primitive woodland paradise of 1609 into an unrecognizable agricultural and then urban environment. Since the earliest Dutch prints of New Amsterdam in the book already show a treeless tip of southern Manhattan, the colonists clearly wasted no time in proceeding with an aggressive program of land-clearing and filling. Perhaps few records exist, but it would have been interesting to learn more about how this happened, and how the deforestation progressed over the decades. For that matter, the calculated rapaciousness with which the natural environment of Manhattan was destroyed over 3 centuries also gets short shrift; to anyone acquainted with the degraded environment of NY City today & the meager environmental consciousness of its citizenry, Sanderson is oddly optimistic as he compares the 'natural biosphere' of the virgin landscape of 1609 to the 'human biosphere' of Times Square in 2009, and talks enthusiastically about a green NY which sounds more like Portland, Oregon.

Dr. Sanderson also digresses with lengthy chapters best described as philosophical ruminations on the nature of environmental research, the composition of biospheres, and the super-green Manhattan of 2409 (a wildly-optimistic scenario which combines elements of agriculture and a Disney 'city of tomorrow') only indirectly related to recreating Manhattan's lush original environment. The chapter on Manhattan's original inhabitants, the Lenni Lenape indians is fascinating, but only emphasizes how utterly the historical record of these people, who dwelt on Manhattan for hundreds of generations, has been erased.

Fully the last quarter of the book is a series of appendices, some of which are fascinating (catalog of the brooks, streams, and ponds of Manhattan), though one wonders whether so many lists were really needed.

Dr. Sanderson's enthusiasm for his topic comes through loud and clear. I just wish a bit more of it had been translated into the concrete and included in this book.
